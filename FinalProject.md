# Final Project 

## 05/03/2021 

### Problem Statement that introduces your selected topic, identifies significant goals associated with the implementation of your applied machine learning method, demonstrates why your problem is important, and describes and analyzes the complex nature of your problem including any process oriented causes and effects. Conclude your problem statement with a stated central research question. You are welcome to articulate a central research question in broad and general terms, given the abbreviated time frame for this investigation. 

Fetal mortality is a serious in countries throughout the world. In fact, 1 in 160 deliveries still results in stillbirth in the United States, It is a goal of nations and health care providers globally to reduce fetal mortality rates and increase fetal health as a whole. In order to take that step, it is crucial to be able to measure and predict the health of a fetus. One way to measure fetal health is by using a machine known as a Cardiotocogram (CTG). These are not too complex and are a cheap and accessible way to measure fetal health. CTGs function by sending ultrasound pulses and reading the responses. This allows for the collection of fetal heart rate (FHR), fetal movements, uterine contractions, etc. 

In order to

Data
This dataset contains 2126 records of features extracted from Cardiotocogram exams, which were then classified by three expert obstetritians into 3 classes:

Normal
Suspect
Pathological

### A description of the data that you are using as input for your applied machine learning methodology, including the source of the data, the different features (variables) and well as their data class (i.e. continuous or discrete). Be sure to include a description of your dataset size (number of rows / observations as well as number of columns / variables / features) and provide context on how the data was collected as well as the source organization, as it is relevant to your investigation. 

### Provide the specification for your applied machine learning method that presented the most promise in providing a solution to your problem. Include the section from your python or R script that specifies your model architecture, layers, functional arguments and specifications for compiling and fitting. Provide a brief description of how you implemented your code in practice. 

### Conclude with a section that preliminarily assesses model performance. If you have results from your implementation, you are welcome to add those in this section. Compare your preliminary results with those from the literature on your topic for a comparative assessment. If you are not able to produce preliminary results, provide a cursory literature review that includes 2 sources that present and describes their validation. With more time and project support, estimate what an ideal outcome looks like in terms of model validation.
