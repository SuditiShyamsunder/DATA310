# Informal Response 1

Question 1: Laurence Maroney argued in his video that the main differnce between traditional programming and machine learning is whether we use rules to create answers or we use answers to create rules. He showed a diagram that explained that in traditional programming, data and rules are utilized to determine answers to whatever problem is attempting to be solved. Alternatively, in machine learning, data and the answers are being fed to create rules that can them be generalized. 

Question 2: After modifying the script to produce the output for the value 7, I received predictions of 22.001947 and 22.001925. These values are not exactly the same, which makes sense since the models being built on the data are slightly different each time, but they are both similar and very close to the value 22, which is what you would predict if you used a mathematical formula instead. 

Question 3:
