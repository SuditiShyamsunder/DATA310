Since not all the values are 0 or 1, some links are weighed more heavily, meaning it is a weighted network. \n",

Row 2 (B) and Column 3 (C) has a link of weight 3, but Column 2 (B) and Row 3 (C) has a value of 0 that signifies there is no link in that direction. Therefore, this is a directed network. \n",
